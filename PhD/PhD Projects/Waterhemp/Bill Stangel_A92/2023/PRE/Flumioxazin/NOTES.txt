BIOMASS DATA IS WORSE THAN COUNTS

USING PERCENTCOUNTS DATA THE ED50 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN R AND S GETS EVEN SMALLER, BUT WITH LOWER SE AND LOWER P-VALUE (STILL NOT SIGNIFICANT)

USING COUNTRED DATA THE UPPER LIMIT FOR THE S POPULATION HAS A BAD ESTIMATION (SUPPOSED TO BE 100). PERHAPS BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE 2X,4X, AND 8X FOR THIS POPULATION
